Working with Strings - Part 1

15.1 Take the ISBN property of the first book from the books array, and log to the console characters at index 6, 4, 9 and 8. Use bracket notation to access individual characters.

15.2 Below is the quote variable that stores a string. Find the index of the word 'chess', and log it to the console.

```
const quote = 'A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing';
```

15.3 Extract the word "boxing" from the same quote string, and log it to the console.

15.4 Some authors are noted as "(Contributor)", for example "Julie Sussman (Contributor)". Create a function called isContributor that takes an author's name as an argument, and returns either true (if he's a contributor) of false (if he's not a contributor). The string "(Contributor)" is always the last part of the author's name string.

Example 1

```
isContributor('Julie Sussman (Contributor)');
```

Expected output: true

# Run
